        <div id="div1"  class="div-1">  
       <h2>Key Principles</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li><b>Visibility:</b> make all content visible</li>
            <li><b>Consistency:</b>  be consistent across all forms of content </li>
            <li><b>Feedback:</b> Provide clear, easy-to-understand feedback</li>
            <li><b>Constraint:</b> Use constraints to restrict the users from performing undesired actions</li>
            <li><b>Affordances:</b> Use affordances to help the user perform desired actions</li>
            <li><b></b> Make the applications accessible for those with disabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Complexity Principles </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Learn while doing!</li>
            <li>For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced.</li>
            <li>Complexity is necessary when we have apps that have a lot of functionality</li>
            <li>Make the meaning of icons clear and intuitive. </li>
            <li>Recognize when to simplify user interactions.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h2>Cultural</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Be considerate of the different languages that will be used; some countries read from left to right, and others read from right to left. </li>
            <li>Gestures, symbols, and words have different meanings in different cultures. What may be a friendly gesture in one culture might be an offensive one in a different culture.</li>
            <li>Avoid idioms, metaphors, and phrases that are common in only one culture.</li>
            <li>Be aware of the users’ comfort with uncertainty and authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Accessibility Aspects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep in mind the acronym POUR</li>

            <div id="div2" class="div-2">
        <h2>Cognitive Design Principles</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Attention:</b> Make information salient when it requires attention at a given stage of the task. Use techniques to achieve this when designing visual interfaces such as animated graphics, color, underlining, ordering of items, and spacing of items. Avoid cluttering visual interfaces.</li>
                <li><b>Perception:</b> Representations of information need to be designed to be perceptible and recognizable across different media—design icons and other graphical representations so that users can easily distinguish between them. Use obvious separators and white space when grouping information. Use audio sounds that are easily distinguishable. Learn color combinations so they can be used in a way the users find easily perceivable.</li>
                <li><b>Memory:</b> Reduce cognitive load by avoiding lengthy and complicated procedures for carrying out tasks. Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall by using familiar interaction patterns. Provide users with a variety of ways of labeling digital information.</li>
                <li><b>Learning:</b> designing interfaces that encourage exploration. Design interfaces that constrain and guide users to select appropriate actions when initially learning. 
                <li><b>Reading, Speaking, and listening:</b>Keep the length of speech-based menus and instructions to a minimum. Accentuate the information of artificially generated speech voices. Provide opportunities for making text large on screen without affecting the formatting</li> 
                <li><b>Problem-solving, planning, reasoning, and decision-making:</b> Provide information and help pages. Use simple and memorable functions. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>WIMP Model</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li><b>Windows:</b> Sections of the screen that can be scrolled, stretched, overlapped, opened, closed, and moved using a mouse</li>
            <li><b>Icons:</b> Pictogramsthat represent applications, objects, commands, and tools that are opened or activated when clicked on</li>
            <li><b>Menus:</b> list of options that can be scrolled through and selected in the way a menu is used in a restaurant</li>
            <li><b>Pointing device:</b> A mouse controlling the cursor as a point of entry to the windows, menus, and icons on the screen</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Four basic activities of interaction design</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Discovering requirements for the interactive product</li>
            <li>Designing alternatives that meet those requirements</li>
            <li>Prototyping the alternative designs so that they can be communicated and assessed</li>
            <li>Evaluating the product and the user experience it offers throughout the process</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div id="group3" class="floatRight"> 
            <div id="div3" class="div-3">
        <h2>Conceptional Principles</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Use intuitive designs, don’t make the users think too hard to figure out how to use the features of your website. </li>
            <li>Design conceptional models with the users in mind.</li>
            <li>Use a conceptual model that fits the mental model. </li>
            <li>Use a familiar framework for your app using a conceptional model</li>
            <li>Design the conceptional model purposely</li>
            <li>Be wary of a poor or erroneous model</li>
            <li>Make sure the mental model and conceptional model match</li>
            <li>Familiarity is more important than novelty </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Human centered design Principles</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Put human needs, capabilities, and behavior first 
            </li>
            <li>Design to meet the needs, capabilities and ways of behaving</li>
            <li>Have good communication between people and machines</li>
            <li>Designers should focus on when/how things go wrong, not just when things work as planned.</li>
            <li>Provide discoverability</li>
            <li>Provide feedback </li>
            <li>Utilize a conceptional model </li>
            <li>Include affordances, signifiers, and constraints</li>
            <li>Ensure you have good mappings</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Five Key Issues with Data Gathering</h2>
        <ol> 
            <li><b>Setting goals:</b> It is important to set specific goals for the study, as this will impact the type of data-gathering techniques that will be used and determine the type of analysis that will be performed. </li>
            <li><b>Identifying Participants:</b>The goals that were developed for the data-gathering sessions will indicate the types of people from whom data is to be gathered. Statistics plays a large part in this process since the developers, stakeholders, and investors want to ensure their product will be profitable and that their users will enjoy the product.</li>
            <li><b>Relationship with Participants:</b> Maintaining a clear, professional relationship between those conducting the research and those participating in the research is a key element in the process of gathering data</li>
            <li><b>Triangulation:</b> a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives</li>
            <li><b>Pilot Studies:</b> a pilot study is a small trial run of the main study. The aim is to ensure the proposed method is viable before starting the real study. It is done to ensure the questionnaire is clear and concise, the experiment is viable, and to spot problems in advance so that they can be fixed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Interface Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the product intuitive to use.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of conventions, and support hierarchies of information.</li>
            <li>Keep paragraphs short and concise</li>
            <li>Use bulleted lists, tables, and clear headings.</li>
            <li>Break pages up into clearly-defined areas using borders or white space.</li>
        </ul>
